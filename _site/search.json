The three areas selected for inspection are shown in the map below covering the North, Centre and South of Santiago. The North periphery (Colina) is known for the presence of affluent suburban single-family houses organised in gated communities. The centre (Santiago) is still considered the civic centre of the capital. The South periphery (La Pintana) is an area of high density of social housing that will be radically transformed by the forthcoming construction of a Metro line.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# chilemapas\nmapa_comunas %>%\n  st_as_sf() %>%\n  st_set_crs(\"EPSG:4326\") -> cl_comunas\n\ncl_comunas %>%\n  filter(codigo_region == \"13\") %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(fill = NA, col = \"grey\", lwd = 0.4) +\n  geom_sf(data = scl_s, col = \"tomato\", fill = NA) +\n  geom_sf_label(data = scl_s, aes(label = name), size = 2.5, alpha=0.5, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.03) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\nCut-off study areas with relative equidistance from CBD (Santiago)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa Pintana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map allows to compare the building outlines against satellite imagery available as a basemap. It can be observed that the AI mapping is quite good at detecting building footprints in the North and South periphery. However, in the presence of buildings that are in high proximity (La Pintana in the South), the outline drawn often does not differentiate between units. Meanwhile, at the centre where there are plenty of high-rises and more complex buildings the outlines are occasionally absent or draw strange shapes. As Microsoft states ‘… the vast majority of cases the quality is at least as good as hand digitized buildings in OpenStreetMap. It is not perfect, particularly in dense urban areas but it provides good recall in rural areas’. It could be argued that the contribution of this global mapping effort is valuable, in particular for cartographic-deprived areas. Moreover, like in the case of this exercise, interesting urban density metrics could be computed to compare and describe urban planing and design practice3. For example, it could be expected from the areas visualised in the interactive map, that the difference of open space metrics between affluent and deprived areas would be quite noteworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3M building footprints for Santiago’s region, Region Metropolitana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nSee Microsoft’s AI Assisted Mapping↩︎\nSee repository↩︎\nSee Ground Space Index that describes the amount of built ground in an area, and related work Spacemate↩︎\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{palominos2022,\n  author = {Nicolas Palominos},\n  title = {Building Footprints from {Bing} {Maps} Imagery},\n  date = {2022-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nNicolas Palominos. 2022. “Building Footprints from Bing Maps\nImagery.” May 2022."

    "text": "Python packages\nThere are a handful of packages to read OSM data directly into the programming environment. In my experience Python packages have resulted to be more reliable when downloading data than those available in R. The main difference between the most common packages OSMnx3 and Pyrosm4, is that OSMnx reads the data from the OverPass API and Pyrosm reads data from PBF data providers. In this exercise I’ll adapt the code we used for a study that explores new trends in mapping the space of the street in OpenStreetMap5.\n\n\nAn atlas of urban form\nThe form of cities can be studied through many different approaches6. In this study I chose to examine the urban topography of cities by plotting 3 sets of data for 9 city centres: the street grid7, green & blue features and Points of Interest. Each city centre was defined as a ~5 square km cut-off from a selected central landmark. The resulting drawings are displayed at the same scale side-by-side not only to provide orientation about the different morphological patterns but also to compare the different urban dimensions8. Some interesting observations can be made. Water bodies and big green areas establish a certain of order that’s followed by street grids. Central Park in New York is as large as the system of parks in London (St. James, Green and Hyde parks) an also comparable in size with the Parque Metropolitano in Santiago (Cerro San Cristobal). Surprisingly Barcelona doesn’t have a central large green area, and the same applied to Mexico City and Lima. While the density of Points of Interest is biased by the potential higher mapper activities, there tends to be a trend of higher concentration of POI in cities that seem to have higher street level activity and density at their centres (Paris, Barcelona, London, New York, Tokyo).\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nSee ‘100 million edits to OpenStreetMap | OpenStreetMap Blog’ (no date).

The user is presented with a default view comparing the satellite views of Central London with Central Santiago at a zoom level of 14 (1:35000 ~ scale on screen4). To compare between any place worldwide, the lat,lng pair of coordinates in EPSG:4326 decimal degrees notation should be entered in the search box. The pair of coordinates for a place can be easily obtained from Google Maps. Then, the level of zoom has to be set (e.g. 19 for a scale of ~ 1:1000).

Overall, it can be observed that this corresponds with University cities which would tend to have younger populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting each region side-by-side at the same scale allows to compare the different bicycle travel patterns. It is clear that London, for example, tends to be more monocentric than the other regions where more than one bicycle destination is highlighted.\n\n\n\n\nRegions with highest bicycle flows (cut-off square of ~100 kms)\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking commute\nThe same scripts can be used to visualise the patterns of people on-foot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now observe a different set of regions, however, London and Greater Manchester are still at the top which is not surprising given that these are the most populated areas in the UK.\n\n\nTravel by Foot\n \n  \n    Region \n    Total \n    Maximum \n  \n \n\n  \n    London \n    233591 \n    1293 \n  \n  \n    Greater-Manchester \n    76522 \n    975 \n  \n  \n    West-Yorkshire \n    61787 \n    798 \n  \n  \n    Wales \n    57842 \n    846 \n  \n  \n    West-Midlands \n    54413 \n    525 \n  \n  \n    North-East \n    53878 \n    890 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoot flows for 6 top cities centred at the desire line with highest count\n\n\n\nWhen comparing areas with highest bicycle and foot flows it is interesting to note that only London and Manchester have high number of trips for both modes. High performing cities at walking commute that could have the potential to increase bicycle trips are Leeds, Cardiff, Birmingham and Newcastle. From the walking flows it is possible to observe that there is quite a big variation in the length of the desire line with highest flow count (subtitle), varying from 2435 m in London to 772 m in Wales (Cardiff).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture points\nAs an illustration the bicycle flows plot contains ~300k origin-destination lines. Often, this kind of plots tend to get cluttered making it difficult to identify meaningful patterns (the total number of links between n set of nodes is n(n-1)/2). An important contribution of this graphic is that it can provide a synoptic comparative view of flow patterns that relate to the morphology of cities. Additional quantitative analysis could be done by calculating the centrality degree distribution of the studied areas to investigate how the number of connections vary across origins and destinations.\nMoreover, the code in this exercise can be adapted to investigate other patterns by mode of travel or include other parameters such as travel by age groups (see data in UK Data Service3). Additionally, instead of highlighting the areas with high density of active travel flows, this approach could be used to identify areas where there could be a modal shift from car travel to active travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nA version of this exercise was featured in the twitter feed of R posts you might have missed!↩︎\nSee the Propensity to Cycle Tool project website↩︎\nSee UK Data Service↩︎\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{palominos2022,\n  author = {Nicolas Palominos},\n  title = {Travel Patterns in {UK} Cities},\n  date = {2022-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nNicolas Palominos. 2022. “Travel Patterns in UK Cities.”\nMay 2022."

    "text": "The streetspace allocation dataset for London\nAfter downloading and before reading the data the following packages are loaded to run the code.\n\n\nCode\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(extrafont)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n#install.packages(\"scico\")\nlibrary(scico)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n\nThen we can read the data (earlier the dataset was converted to RDS to reduce its size)\n\n\nCode\nsa <- readRDS(\"streetspace_dataset.rds\")\n\n# read wards data\n# dir.create(\"./data_raw\")\ntarget.file <- \"./data_raw/wards.zip\"\n\ndownload.file(url = \"https://data.london.gov.uk/download/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/08d31995-dd27-423c-a987-57fe8e952990/London-wards-2018.zip\", destfile = target.file)\nunzip(target.file, overwrite = TRUE, exdir = \"./data_raw/\")\n# file.remove(target.file)  # Delete the zip file\n\n# Read the unzipped file\nlw <- st_read(\"./data_raw/London-wards-2018_ESRI/London_Ward.shp\", quiet = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nCreating the streetspace index\nThe streetspace index is calculated taking the Link and Place framework as a reference 3. A 3x3 matrix is created from 3 classes of footway and carriageways (low, mid and high widths). The matrix describes a double slope surface to which all values (footway and carriageway widths) are fitted.\nAn approximate score from 1-9 is assigned according streetspace allocation metrics and their relationship. I tested different plane functions (different scores) but chose Index 3 which I believe most closely approximates to the negative/positive impacts of street design in the environmental quality of streets. For example, a street with wide footway (high pedestrian space) and narrow carriageway (low vehicular space) scores 9. While a score of 1 is assigned to streets at the opposite corner of the matrix (low pedestrian space and high vehicular space). Similarly, a street with low-low space scores (7) higher than a street with high-high space (3). This assumes that the negative impact of wide carriageways (despite the presence of wide footways) is higher than the negative impact of narrow pavements (despite the presence of narrow carriageways). Overall, a general rule for this scoring matrix is that being the footway equal streets with wider carriageways have lower scores and being the carriageway equal streets with wider footways have higher scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nStreetspace allocation scoring matrices that were tested\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the scoring approach (and function: x - 3*y + 9), we can calculate the streetspace index (S-Index). This takes all footways (x) and carriageways (y) widths, apply the plane function and transform the results to a scale of 1-100\n\n\nCode\nsa %>%\n  mutate(sco3 = foW - 3*caW + 9,\n         # min-max normalisation * 100\n         S_Index = ((sco3 - min(sco3)) / (max(sco3) - min(sco3))*100)) -> sai\n\n\nHow does the index work? The interactive plot for a sample of 10,000 streets shows the final index after applying the scoring function to the street’s footways and carriagways widths. It can be seen that the streetspace index (S-Index - scoring 3) performs better when looking at streets with the same ratio (e.g. those following the direction of the grey line). This reveals that unlike the other indices, there is a clear differentiation between streets with high-high and low-low streetspace metrics. This also applies to the extra index labelled as Diff, that take the subtraction of Footway - Carriageway widths, which won’t differentiate between streets with the same ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping the S-Index\nBefore mapping the S-Index it is useful to look at the distribution of values, which is this case is near normal.\n\n\nCode\nsai %>%\n  # make 10 groups with equal number of observations\n  mutate(cut = cut_number(S_Index, n = 10),\n         avg = mean(S_Index),\n         median = median(S_Index)) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  # mean\n  annotate(\"text\", x=mean(sai$S_Index), y=4000, label=paste(\"Mean\", round(mean(sai$S_Index),1), sep = \" \"), family = \"Georgia\", size = 3, hjust = 1.05) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(S_Index)), colour=\"gray55\", size=.15) +\n  # median\n  annotate(\"text\", x=median(sai$S_Index), y=4000, label=paste(\"Median\", round(median(sai$S_Index),1), sep = \" \"), family = \"Georgia\", size = 3, hjust = -0.05) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(S_Index)), colour=\"gray55\", size=.15) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(S_Index, fill = cut), binwidth = 0.1) +\n  theme_tufte() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colorRampPalette(mycols)(10), name = \"\") +\n  labs(y = \"\", x=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting a section of London with 10 classes of the S-Index shows an interesting pattern. Main thoroughfares can be identified in the lower tiers coloured in red (potentially with higher vehicular traffic) while it is possible to identify a cluster of ‘blue’ streets in the West End area which corresponds with higher street level pedestrian activity.\n\n\nCode\nsai %>%\n  mutate(cut = cut_number(S_Index, n = 10)) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(aes(col = cut), size = 0.4, show.legend = \"line\") +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = colorRampPalette(mycols)(10), name = \"S-Index\") +\n  theme_tufte() +\n  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +\n  coord_sf(expand = FALSE, xlim = c(521665.5110, 540778.3620), ylim = c(176883.0072,182798.4996), datum = 27700) -> psl\n\ngrid.arrange(psl, plsec, lbnl, widths = c(5,2,1))\n\n\n\n\n\nS-Index for a section of London\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfiling London boroughs with the S-Index\nThe S-Index can be summarised by Borough to compare their performance and visualise where there is opportunity for intervention. The scoring matrix in Section 0.3 shows how the reallocation of streetspace following a bottom-left direction of the matrix (low-high to high-low) will improve the S-Index. The table below shows a summary of the S-Index and street metrics by Borough. It doesn’t appear surprising that Westminster (City of Westminster) is the worst performing not only due to the large number of mayor roads crossing through the borough but also probably because of their well-known car-oriented policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nSee chapter 4 of PhD thesis Rethinking Streets: a study of streetspace allocation metrics and street networks in London↩︎\nSee repository and technical specifications↩︎\nSee Jones, P., Boujenko, N. and Marshall, S., 2007.

As an urban design researcher, I look for basic rules about how city systems work and relate to each other, which can direct us to understand cities as structures of organised complexity, constantly evolving and adapting. As a data scientist, I discover key information from complex data, using urban analytics tools."

    "text": "Research Findings/Interests\nMy PhD dissertation “Rethinking Streets: a study of streetspace allocation metrics and street networks in London” argues that streetspace allocation is a key parameter of street design and provides both a methodology for streetspace allocation analysis citywide, and quantitative evidence that confirm the predominance of space allocated for vehicular transport over pedestrian uses in a case study of London. The fine-grain physical metrics analysed, not only can be useful to tackle a wide range of contemporary street related questions from urban environmental quality to the adoption of new technologies but also offer alternative analytical methods for street research, planning and design.\n“From different perspectives, streets are considered fundamental components of urban form, urban transport and urban life. As is typically the case of complex systems like cities, these urban factors are varying simultaneously and interconnected as a functioning city system. The understanding of each of these factors in isolation would only provide a partial picture of the workings of the street system, so the challenge is in reviewing how they are combined together. A fourth factor of relevance to understanding streets and streetspace, which keeps this relationship evolving, is the development of new technologies that often influence urban transportation first but can have lasting effects on the other factors” (p 14).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There is a general agreement among scholars that streets are an important determinant of the functioning of urban systems. Nevertheless, streets take this relevant condition not only by historical evolution but most importantly by design. Given the explosive post-industrial global urbanisation it can be conjectured that most streets of today were designed and built following functionalist principles of traffic movement efficiency that profoundly impacted the shape and vitality of cities, which has been termed a disurban legacy. It could be argued, however, that these principles no longer seem to fit with current urban mobility systems and urban quality of life aspirations. Moreover, they are largely contrary to sustainable urban development. An important design problem arises from the inherited conditions that shaped not only the physical organisation of streets but also the spatial configuration of street systems. The design constraints are defined by both the endurance of street layouts, due to the rigidity of land ownership structures, and by the establishment of land-use patterns based on automobile-dependency. All things considered, streetspace allocation turns out to be a crucial factor for street adaptation to new urban functions that result from the development of new technologies affecting urban mobility in particular” (p 59)1."

**Urban data scientist, city designer, planner, architect and innovator**

I see myself in the face of the challenge of making better cities as both 'urban design researcher' and 'data scientist'. As an urban design researcher, I look for basic rules about how city systems work and relate to each other, which can direct us to understand cities as structures of organised complexity, constantly evolving and adapting. As a data scientist, I discover key information from complex data, using urban analytics tools.
